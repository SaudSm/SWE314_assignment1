# Software Security Engineering Assignment 1

Welcome to the first assignment of our class. In this assignment, you are required to work in groups. It is crucial to cooperate and contribute meaningfully to your team. I strongly recommend scheduling meetings to discuss and distribute the workload among your team members effectively.

## Project Setup:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If not, download them from [Node.js&#39;s official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the project and set it up locally:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

* Open a terminal and navigate to your desired folder.
* Run `git clone <repository-url>` to clone the project. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual repository URL.
* Enter the project directory with `cd <project-name>`.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

* Inside the project directory, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

#### 3. Run the Project

* Start the project by running `npm start`.
* Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Assignment Tasks [15 points]:

To achieve full marks (20/20) in this assignment, you must complete all **four** tasks. Each task requires a combination of written documentation and modifications to the source code:

* Subtasks marked with [document] necessitate a written explanation or analysis. Your responses for these should be compiled into a document and submitted in PDF format.
* Subtasks labeled with [code] require you to implement changes directly in the source code of the project.

Ensure that your submission addresses both the documentation and coding aspects as outlined, to meet the assignment's full criteria.

### Task 1: Identifying SQL Injection Vulnerability

* **[Document] Screenshot the Vulnerable Code:** Take a screenshot of the code segment vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. [1 point]
* **[Document] Explain the Vulnerability:**  Discuss and give an example of how the vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker. [1 point]
* **[Code] Fix the Vulnerability:** Implement a code fix to mitigate the SQL injection vulnerability. Ensure your solution effectively prevents SQL injection attacks.[2 point]

### Task 2: Secure Password Storage

The application currently stores passwords in plaintext, which is insecure.

* **[Document] Problem Explanation**: Explain why storing passwords in plaintext is a security risk. [1 point]
* **[Code] Solution Implementation**: Implement a solution to hash passwords before storing them in the database. Note that users who are registered before hashing is implemented will no longer be able to login, which is ok. [2 points]

### Task 3: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Implement two-factor authentication using Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) and an authenticator app.

* **[Code] User Registration**: Modify the user registration process to include an option for 2FA setup, similar to our class demonstration. [2 points]
* **[Code] Login Modification**: Adjust the login process to require a TOTP code from the authenticator app each time a user logs in.[2 points]
* **[Code] Encrypt Two-Factor Authentication Secret**: Ensure that the 2FA secret stored on the server is encrypted for enhanced security. Use AES with 256-bit key length. [2 points]

### Task 4: Mitigating Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

The application is currently vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

* **[Document] Vulnerability Explanation**: Explain why the application is vulnerable to MitM attacks. [1 point]
* **[Code] Solution Implementation**: Implement a solution to mitigate MitM attacks. [1 point]

## Submission Instructions

To ensure a smooth submission process for this assignment, please follow the steps outlined below. This will involve combining your documentation (PDF file) with the project source code, preparing the final submission package, and uploading it to Blackboard.

### Preparing Your Submission

* **Combine Documentation and Source Code**: Ensure that your written documentation, including analyses and explanations for all [document] subtasks, is compiled into a single PDF file. The PDF file should clearly state your team name and outline the contributions made by each team member to different parts of the assignment.
* **Prepare the Source Code**: Go through your project source code to ensure all [code] subtasks are correctly implemented and commented as needed.
* **Remove node_modules Directory**: Before packaging your project, delete the node_modules directory to reduce the size of your submission. This folder can be easily regenerated by running npm install and does not need to be submitted.
* **Zip Your Project** : Create a zip file containing your project's source code (excluding the `node_modules` directory) and the PDF document. Ensure the zip file is named appropriately, preferably including your team number and the assignment number, e.g., `TeamNumber_Assignment1.zip`.
* **Submit** **to Blackboard.**
